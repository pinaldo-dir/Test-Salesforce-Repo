You have now submitted your application for a Farm Labor Contractor License.

Once your submission is processed, you will be notified of approval via e-mail or defect with an attached explanation of the outstanding issues.

If you wish to print a copy of your submission for your records, you may do so by logging into the registration site, and click on the &quot;Email a Copy&quot; link on the left.



IMPORTANT: Successful completion of the examination does not authorize you to operate as a Farm Labor Contractor. It is illegal to operate as a Farm Labor Contractor business without first obtaining a Farm Labor Contractor License from the State Labor Commissioner&apos;s Office. If you operate without a valid license, you will be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Thank you,
