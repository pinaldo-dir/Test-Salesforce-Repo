    <subject>Performance Appraisal Summary â€“ PAST DUE</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,



A review of our records shows that an annual Performance Appraisal Summary (PAS) has not been received in the Human Resources Office (HRO) for {!Performance_Appraisal_Tracking__c.Employee_Full_Name__c} and is now past due.



To ensure compliance with the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) and government code requirements, the completed PAS (STD 638) must be emailed to the HRO at PerformanceAppraisals-HR@dir.ca.gov as soon as possible.



For questions regarding the PAS process, please email the HRO at PerformanceAppraisals-HR@dir.ca.gov.


Thank you,

Human Resources</textOnly>
