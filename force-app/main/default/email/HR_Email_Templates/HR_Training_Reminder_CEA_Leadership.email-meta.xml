    <textOnly>Hello,

You are receiving this email because our records indicate that you have not completed the California Department of Human Resources (CalHR) mandatory 20-hour Executive Development Program. California Government Code section 19995.4 and CalHR’s Human Resources Manual section 2801 require all newly appointed Career Executive Assignments (CEAs) complete this training within twelve months of appointment.

If you have already completed this training and to receive course credit, send a copy of your certificate of completion to the Office of Administrative Services (OAS) Training Unit at Training@dir.ca.gov.

If you have not fulfilled this training requirement, you must complete the following steps:

Step 1 – CalHR CalLearns Registration and Course Enrollment

To register for the 20-hour Executive Development Program training, you must create an account on CalHR’s online learning management system CalLearns using your DIR email address.

Once you have created a CalLearns account, log into the CalLearns system, search for the appropriate course titled “California Leadership Academy - Executive Development Program (20-Hour),” and add it to your cart. Upon checkout, designate your direct supervisor to approve the course. Your supervisor will then receive an email notification from CalHR Statewide Training to review your training request.

After your supervisor approves the course, you will receive an email from CalHR Statewide Training confirming your registration for the class. You should save this email for your records.

Step 2 - Payment Request

Once you receive the registration confirmation email and prior to the scheduled course date, you must complete DIR’s Request for OutService Training (OSTR) form and submit the completed form to the Office of Administrative Services (OAS) Training Unit at Training@dir.ca.gov.

When completing the OSTR form, you must include your applicable service location number and reporting structure number located on the DIR Accounting Intranet page. You must also ensure the form has all required signatures prior to submitting it to the OAS Training Unit.

Step 3 – Tracking Completion of Mandatory Training

After completing the mandatory training and to receive course credit, you must email a copy of your certificate of completion to the OAS Training Unit at Training@dir.ca.gov.

If you have any questions, you may contact the OAS Training Unit at Training@dir.ca.gov.

Thank you!</textOnly>
