    <description>Different data than Check__c.Certified_Mail_Tracking_No__c, though may be linked through automation later. This field is used mainly for Direct Payments which don't have Check__c records.

This field is a long text area, as opposed to the one on the Check which is a Text (100) field, as there could be very many tracking numbers related to one CP.</description>
